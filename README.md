# BE_model
source code used for the solution of the Beris-Edwards model

BerisEdwards4.C contains the constitutive equation of the Beris-Edwards model. Firstly, the angular momentum equation for the distribution of the Q-tensor is solved. Then, based on the microstructure orientation, a viscoelastic stress tensor is computed.

BerisEdwards4.H is the header file and contains definitions of the relevant variables.
